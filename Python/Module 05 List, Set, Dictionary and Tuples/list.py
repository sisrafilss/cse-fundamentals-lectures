# declaration of a list
numbers = [11, 13, 27, 15, 12, 49, 35]

# list is zero index based like other programming language
print(numbers[1]) # this will print 13

# python list support backward index, where index -1 refers the last element of the list, -2 refers the 2nd last element and so on ...
print(numbers[-2]) # this will print 49

# we can slice a list using colon (:), syntax is: list[start_index : end_index], where start_index is inclusive and end_index is exclusive
print(numbers[0:3]) # this will print [11, 13, 27]
print(numbers[:3]) # this will print all elements from index 0 to index 3 (exclusive)
print(numbers[3:]) # this will print all elements from index 3(inclusive) to end of the list


# we can also specify the sequence of slicing list. by default it is set to 1. see the examples below
print(numbers[0:6:1]) # this will print all elements from index 0(inclusive) to index 6(exclusive) one by one - [11, 13, 27, 15, 12, 49]
print(numbers[0:6:2]) # this will print all elements from index 0(inclusive) to index 6(exclusive), but it skip the index 1, 3, and 5. because we set the third parameter to 2

# slicing also works on negetive index
print(numbers[5:2:-1]) # this will print the elements from index 5(inclusive) to index 2(exclusive) by going backward by one (-1)

print(numbers[::-1]) # this will print the entire array backward, also numbers[:] print the entire array
