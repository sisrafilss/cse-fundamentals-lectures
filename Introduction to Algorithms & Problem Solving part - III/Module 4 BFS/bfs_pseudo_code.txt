Pseudocode of BFS
===================

Input -> Connected Graph and a "source"
Output -> Traverse all nodes and print the traversal order.

Complexity:
Time - O(V+E)
Space - O(V)

BFS(graph, source):
    - Initiate an array called "visited" and an empty queue "q"
    - Mark visited[source] = 1 and q.push(source)
    - While the queue is not empty:
        - head = q.front()
        - q.pop()
        - print the node "head"
        - for all adjacent node of head:
            if visited[adj_node] == 0:
                visited[adj_node] = 1 and q.push(adj_node)
